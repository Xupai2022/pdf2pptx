# PDF to PPTX Converter Configuration

# PDF Parsing Configuration
parser:
  dpi: 300
  extract_images: true
  image_format: "PNG"
  min_text_size: 6
  max_text_size: 72
  
  # Chart detection configuration
  min_shapes_for_chart: 3  # Minimum number of shapes to form a chart
  cluster_distance_threshold: 50  # Max distance (pt) between shapes in same cluster
  min_chart_area: 10000  # Minimum chart area in pt²
  chart_render_dpi: 600  # DPI for rendering charts as images (higher = sharper)

# Layout Analysis Configuration
analyzer:
  title_threshold: 20  # Font size threshold for titles
  min_paragraph_chars: 10
  group_tolerance: 10  # Pixels tolerance for grouping elements
  detect_headers: true
  detect_footers: true

# Coordinate Mapping Configuration
rebuilder:
  # PowerPoint slide dimensions (will be auto-adjusted to match PDF dimensions)
  # These are initial defaults, but actual dimensions will be set to match each PDF's size
  # This ensures 1:1 scale: PDF 18pt font → PPT 18pt font
  slide_width: 20.0  # inches (default, will be overridden)
  slide_height: 11.25  # inches (default, will be overridden)
  margin_left: 0.0  # No margins to match HTML exactly
  margin_right: 0.0
  margin_top: 0.0
  margin_bottom: 0.0

  # PDF scale correction: NOW FIXED AT 1.0 for exact size preservation
  # No scaling is applied - PDF dimensions map directly to PPT dimensions
  # This preserves font sizes, image sizes, and all element proportions exactly as in PDF
  pdf_to_html_scale: 1.0  # Fixed at 1:1 scale

  # Border width correction: PDF has 5.55pt borders → 7.4pt after scaling, but HTML expects 4pt
  # Correction factor: 4pt / 7.4pt = 0.54
  border_width_correction: 0.54

# Style Mapping Configuration
mapper:
  # Font mapping (PDF font -> PPT font)
  font_mapping:

  default_font: "Arial"
  default_font_size: 18
  title_font_size: 32

  # Font size scaling: NOW FIXED AT 1.0 for exact font size preservation
  # With 1:1 coordinate scaling, font sizes are also preserved exactly
  # PDF 18pt → PPT 18pt (no change)
  # This ensures fonts appear the same size as in the original PDF
  font_size_scale: 1.0  # Fixed at 1:1 scale
  
  # Color schemes
  preserve_colors: true
  default_text_color: "#000000"
  
  # Semi-transparent color mapping (hex -> opacity) BY ROLE
  # NOTE: This transparency_map is now DISABLED because opacity is automatically
  # extracted from PDF ExtGState information. This provides accurate, universal
  # color recognition without hardcoding.
  # 
  # The map is kept for backward compatibility with PDFs that don't have
  # ExtGState opacity information, but it will only be used as a fallback
  # when PDF extraction returns opacity=1.0 (fully opaque).
  #
  # For most modern PDFs (including glm-4.6.pdf), opacity is extracted directly
  # from the PDF structure, ensuring 100% accuracy.
  transparency_map: {}

# PPTX Generation Configuration
generator:
  template: null  # Path to PPTX template (optional)
