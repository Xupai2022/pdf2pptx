  min_chart_area: 10000  # Minimum chart area in pt²

# Coordinate Mapping Configuration
rebuilder:
  # PowerPoint uses 72 DPI standard
  # PDF is generated at 75% scale (1440×811 pt), need to scale back to 1920×1080 px
  slide_width: 26.667  # inches (1920px at 72 DPI = 1920/72 = 26.667")
  slide_height: 15.0  # inches (1080px at 72 DPI = 1080/72 = 15")

  pdf_to_html_scale: 1.333  # 4/3 ratio to convert 1440×811 → 1920×1080
  
  # Border width correction: PDF has 5.55pt borders → 7.4pt after scaling, but HTML expects 4pt
  # Correction factor: 4pt / 7.4pt = 0.54

# Style Mapping Configuration

  # Font size scaling (PDF points to HTML pixels)
  # PDF is generated at 75% scale: 36pt in PDF = 48px in HTML
  # Scaling factor: 1.333 (4/3) converts PDF points to match HTML pixel sizes
  # At 72 DPI: 1 pt = 1 px, so 36pt × 1.333 = 48pt in PowerPoint = 48px equivalent

  # Semi-transparent color mapping (hex -> opacity) BY ROLE
  # NOTE: This transparency_map is now DISABLED because opacity is automatically
  # extracted from PDF ExtGState information. This provides accurate, universal
  # color recognition without hardcoding.
  # 
  # The map is kept for backward compatibility with PDFs that don't have
  # ExtGState opacity information, but it will only be used as a fallback
  # when PDF extraction returns opacity=1.0 (fully opaque).
  #
  # For most modern PDFs (including glm-4.6.pdf), opacity is extracted directly
  # from the PDF structure, ensuring 100% accuracy.
